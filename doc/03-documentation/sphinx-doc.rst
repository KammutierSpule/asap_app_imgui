****************************
Sphinx and restructured text
****************************

.. todo::

  Add documentation for the doxygen part.

The documentation for the project covers two complementary parts: *APIs* and *User Manual*.

The APIs are documented inline with the source code comments using the `doxygen
<https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html>`_ style, while the *User Manual* is written in
`restructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ and uses `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ to generate the final output (HTML, or other).

The *User Manual* refers to the API documentation generated by *doxygen* and therefore it is
necessary to build the API documentation at least once before you build the *User Manual* in order
to have working links in previews and generated files.

Setting up the environment
==========================

It is recommended to use a dedicated environment for python and the additional extensions required
for sphinx documentation. Managing python versions and environments can be done in a multitude of
ways. Describing all of them is out of scope of this documentation. We do however provide
instructions for doing so with Anaconda/Miniconda.

From within the root folder of the project, follow the instructions below:

.. prompt:: bash $,(env)...$ auto

  $ conda create --prefix=./.sphinx python=3.9
  $ conda activate $PWD/.sphinx
  (env)...$ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will have python 3.9 installed in a dedicated environment in the `.sphinx` directory under the
project root. All python modules required to produce the documentation will be installed and ready
to use.

Building the documentation
==========================

For consistency reasons, the documentation build uses CMake similar to what is done for the source
code and related artifacts. Specific targets are defined for generating the *API** documentation and
the *User Manual*.

From within the `build` directory, use the following commands to generate the 
documentation:

.. prompt:: bash $,(env)...$ auto

  $ cmake --build . --target dox
  $ cmake --build . --target sphinx

The generated documentation in `HTML` will be available under the folders `dox` and `sphinx` as
shown below:
